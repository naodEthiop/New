# Google Authentication Setup

## Overview
This project now supports Google authentication alongside email/password authentication. Users can sign up and sign in using their Google accounts.

## Features Added

### 1. Google Sign-In Button
- Prominent Google sign-in button with official Google branding
- Positioned above the email/password form for easy access
- Visual divider separating Google auth from traditional auth

### 2. User Data Management
- Automatically saves Google user data to Firestore
- Handles both new users and returning users
- Preserves user profile information including:
  - Display name
  - Email address
  - Profile photo URL
  - Authentication provider (marked as "google")

### 3. Seamless Integration
- Works with all existing components (Wallet, Profile, Games, etc.)
- No changes needed to other parts of the application
- Maintains consistent user experience

## How It Works

### For New Users
1. User clicks "Continue with Google"
2. Google popup opens for authentication
3. User grants permissions
4. User data is automatically saved to Firestore
5. User is redirected to the main application

### For Returning Users
1. User clicks "Continue with Google"
2. Google popup opens for authentication
3. User is automatically signed in
4. User is redirected to the main application

## Firebase Configuration

### Required Setup in Firebase Console
1. Go to Firebase Console > Authentication > Sign-in method
2. Enable Google as a sign-in provider
3. Configure OAuth consent screen if needed
4. Add authorized domains

### Code Changes Made
1. **Firebase Config** (`src/firebase/config.ts`):
   - Added GoogleAuthProvider import
   - Created and exported googleProvider instance

2. **AuthPage Component** (`src/components/AuthPage.tsx`):
   - Added Google sign-in functionality
   - Added user data management
   - Added loading states and error handling
   - Added visual Google button with official branding

## User Data Structure

When a user signs in with Google, the following data is saved to Firestore:

```javascript
{
  name: user.displayName || "Google User",
  email: user.email,
  phone: user.phoneNumber || "",
  createdAt: new Date(),
  authProvider: "google",
  photoURL: user.photoURL
}
```

## Error Handling

The implementation includes comprehensive error handling:
- Popup closed by user (shows "Sign-in cancelled")
- Network errors
- Firebase authentication errors
- Firestore save errors

## Security Considerations

1. **Domain Restrictions**: Ensure only authorized domains can use Google auth
2. **Data Validation**: All user data is validated before saving
3. **Error Logging**: Errors are logged for debugging but not exposed to users
4. **User Privacy**: Only necessary user data is collected and stored

## Testing

To test Google authentication:

1. **Development**: Works on localhost and Firebase-authorized domains
2. **Production**: Must be deployed to an authorized domain
3. **Mobile**: Works on mobile browsers and PWA
4. **Desktop**: Works on all modern browsers

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Sign-in cancelled"**: User closed the popup - this is normal behavior
2. **"Google sign-in failed"**: Check Firebase console for configuration issues
3. **"Account created successfully"**: New user - data saved to Firestore
4. **"Welcome back"**: Returning user - existing data loaded

### Debug Steps

1. Check Firebase Console > Authentication > Users
2. Check Firestore > users collection
3. Check browser console for error messages
4. Verify domain is authorized in Firebase Console

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for Google authentication:

1. **Profile Photo Integration**: Use Google profile photos in the app
2. **Additional Scopes**: Request additional permissions if needed
3. **Account Linking**: Link Google account to existing email accounts
4. **Social Features**: Share achievements on Google+ (if available)
5. **Analytics**: Track Google auth usage for insights

## Support

For issues with Google authentication:
1. Check Firebase Console configuration
2. Verify domain authorization
3. Test on different browsers/devices
4. Check browser console for errors
5. Review Firebase documentation for latest updates
