# Bonus and Invitation System Features

## Overview

The Abyssinia Bingo platform now includes advanced bonus and invitation systems to enhance the gaming experience and provide more control over game access.

## Bonus System

### Features
- **Extra Prize Pool**: Game hosts can add bonus amounts to increase the total prize pool
- **Automatic Distribution**: Bonuses are automatically added to winner payouts
- **Flexible Amounts**: Hosts can set any bonus amount above 0 ETB
- **Visual Indicators**: Games with bonuses are clearly marked with a green "BONUS" badge

### How It Works
1. When creating a game, hosts can enable the bonus system
2. Set a bonus amount (minimum 1 ETB)
3. The bonus is added to the winner's payout when they win
4. Bonus amounts are displayed in game statistics

### Example
- Entry fee: 50 ETB (10 players = 500 ETB prize pool)
- Bonus: 100 ETB
- Total winner payout: Prize pool percentage + 100 ETB bonus

## Invitation System

### Features
- **Private Games**: Games can be made private with invitation codes
- **6-Digit Codes**: Auto-generated or custom invitation codes
- **Access Control**: Only players with valid codes can join
- **Visual Indicators**: Private games are marked with a purple "PRIVATE" badge

### How It Works
1. When creating a game, hosts can enable the invitation system
2. A 6-digit alphanumeric code is generated automatically
3. Hosts can regenerate codes or use custom codes
4. Players must enter the code to join the game
5. Invalid codes are rejected with clear error messages

### Code Format
- 6 characters long
- Alphanumeric (A-Z, 0-9)
- Case-insensitive input
- Auto-generated format: `ABC123`

## UI Improvements

### Game Lobby

- **Invitation Modal**: Clean interface for entering invitation codes

### Fixed Issues
- **Entry Fee Placeholder**: Correct placeholder text for entry fee input

- **Input Validation**: Better validation for entry fees and bonus amounts
- **Mobile Responsiveness**: Improved layout for mobile devices
